# Create Pandas Dataframe Agent


This is an adaptation of the code used in the [LangChain Pandas Dataframe tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/toolkits/pandas/) to work with local LLMs. It requires Ollama installed - the agent uses Mistral in this case, but can be switched to other models as needed (as long as they are installed on Ollama).
